For my graduation essay – entitled "Transparence, Camouflage, Opacité" – I worked on Dutch design collective [Metahaven](http://www.metahaven.net)'s on going research about an "identity" of the famous whistleblower website and organisation [Wikileaks](http://wikileaks.org/).
<br /><br />
I tried to understand and describe the different and complex aspects of this project and of its context. I gave some interest to the notion of transparency, considered from an historical and architectural perspective. I also attempted to identify Metahaven's process and deeper motivations / strategy. I finally tried to depict an overview of the contemporary issues and ambiguities of a design approach of activism.
